### Financial Projections
We project the following financials for the first three years of operations:

Year	Revenue	Net Income
1	| $1M |	$250K  |
2	| $3M	| $750K  |
3	| $5M	| $1.25M |

We anticipate the initial investment of $3M will be sufficient to fund operations for the first three years.


### Investment Requirements
We are seeking a total investment of $3M to fund the development and launch of our product. The funds will be used for the following purposes:

- Product development: $1M
- Marketing and user acquisition: $1M
- Operational expenses: $1M
-
We are open to different types of investment structures, including equity or debt financing, and are willing to negotiate terms to best suit the interests of our investors. We anticipate a return on investment within three years, with a target return of 15% per year.
